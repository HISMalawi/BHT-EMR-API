  ##
  # Acquire a lock and run the given block of code.
  #
  # The locking mechanism uses files to allow for blocking across processes.
  # This is useful for example in situations where you only want to run one
  # instance of a report.
  #
  # Parameters:
  #   lock_file_path: A relative path to the lock file (allows for namespacing your locks, eg art_service/regimens.lock)
  #   blocking: If lock can not be acquired wait else throw an error (defaults to true)
  #
  # Raises:
  #   FailedToAcquireLock: When lock couldn't be acquired and blocking is set to false
  #
  # Usage:
  #   class Someclass
  #     include ModelUtils
  #
  #     def do_something
  #       with_lock('mylockfile.lock') do
  #         # Run some task requiring exclusive access to some resource
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #   SomeClass.new.do_something
