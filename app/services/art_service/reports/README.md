# About Reports
This folder contains the reports that are generated for the ART module. There are three main categories of reports in the EMR System namely
- MOH
- Clinic
- PEPFAR

## MOH
The MOH reports are the reports that are generated for the Ministry of Health. These reports are generated in the format that is required by the Ministry of Health. Some of the reports that fall under other categories may depend on these reports for validations. These reports are requested and vetted by the Ministry. No report should be added to this category without written approval by the Ministry. Below is a list of all reports available in the system

## Clinic
The clinic reports are the reports that are generated for the clinic. These reports are generated in the format that is required by the clinic. Usually these are requested by the IP's and Clinic Personnel to aid in their daily. Below is a list of all clinic reports available in the system

### To Do
** Some of the reports should be moved to the clinic folder and all references to them updated ** Make sure if we have gems that depends on this they are also update. Highly unlikely though
