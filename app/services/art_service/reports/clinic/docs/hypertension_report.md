# Code Documentation

## Summary
The code snippet is a part of the HypertensionReport class in the ArtService::Reports::Clinic module. It initializes a report structure with nested hashes to store hypertension data based on age groups and gender. It also defines methods to process data and populate the report structure.

## Example Usage
```ruby
report = HypertensionReport.new(start_date: '2021-01-01', end_date: '2021-12-31')
report.find_report
```
 The full namespace
```ruby
ArtService::Reports::Clinic::HypertensionReport.new(start_date: '2021-01-01', end_date: '2021-12-31')
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
```start_date``` (String): The start date of the report period.
```end_date``` (String): The end date of the report period.

## Flow
The ```init_report``` method is called to initialize the report structure with nested hashes for each age group and gender combination.
The ```initialize_gender_metrics``` method is called to initialize the metrics hash for each gender.
The ```process_data``` method is called to process the data and populate the report structure.
The ```data``` method is called to fetch the necessary data from the database using a SQL query.
The fetched data is iterated over, and the relevant information is extracted and stored in the report structure.
The report structure is returned as the result of the ```find_report``` method.

## Outputs
The output of the ```find_report``` method is the report structure, which is a nested hash containing hypertension data categorized by age groups and gender.
