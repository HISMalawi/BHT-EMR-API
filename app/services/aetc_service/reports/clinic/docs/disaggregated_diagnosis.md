2. The 'fetch_report' method is called, which internally calls the 'flatten_report_data' method.
3. The 'flatten_report_data' method processes the diagnosis report data and returns it in a flattened format.
4. The 'process_diagnosis_report' method queries the database to get the diagnosis data and processes it into a nested hash format.
5. The 'diagnosis_report' method executes a SQL query to fetch the diagnosis data from the database.
6. The 'init_age_group_gender_hash' method initializes a hash with age groups and genders as keys and empty arrays as values.
___
### Outputs
