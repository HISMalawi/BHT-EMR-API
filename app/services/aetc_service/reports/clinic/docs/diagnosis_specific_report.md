# Code Documentation: Diagnosis Specific Report
## Summary
The 'Code-Under-Docs' is a class called 'DiagnosisSpecificReport' that generates a report of areas with patients having a specific diagnosis. It fetches data from the database and processes it to return a list of addresses and corresponding patient IDs.

## Example Usage
```ruby
report = DiagnosisSpecificReport.new(start_date: '2021-01-01', end_date: '2021-01-31', diagnosis: ['Malaria'])
data = report.fetch_report
puts data
```
Output:
```
[
  { address: 'Address 1', patient_ids: ['1', '2', '3'] },
  { address: 'Address 2', patient_ids: ['4', '5'] }
]
```

### Flow
1. The class 'DiagnosisSpecificReport' is defined with attributes for start_date, end_date, and diagnosis.
2. The 'initialize' method sets the instance variables based on the provided arguments.
3. The 'fetch_report' method is called to fetch the report data.
4. The 'process_data' method is called to process the fetched data.
5. The 'data' method executes a SQL query to retrieve the report data from the database.
6. The SQL query joins multiple tables and applies various conditions to filter the data.
7. The fetched data is then processed to create a list of addresses and corresponding patient IDs.
8. The processed data is returned as the final report.
