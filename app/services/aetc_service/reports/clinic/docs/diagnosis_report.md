# Code Documentation: Diagnosis Report
## Summary
The code snippet is a class called `DiagnosisReport` that generates a diagnosis report for a clinic. It takes a start date, end date, and an optional age group as inputs. The main flow of the code includes querying the database for diagnosis data, processing the data, and flattening the report into a specific format.

## Example Usage
```ruby
report = DiagnosisReport.new(start_date: '2021-01-01', end_date: '2021-12-31', age_group: '5 to 14')
report.fetch_report
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `start_date`: The start date of the report period.
- `end_date`: The end date of the report period.
- `age_group` (optional): The age group to filter the report by. If not provided, it defaults to 'all'.
___
### Flow
1. The `DiagnosisReport` class is initialized with the start date, end date, and age group.
2. The `fetch_report` method is called, which triggers the generation of the diagnosis report.
3. The `diagnosis` method queries the database for diagnosis data based on the provided dates, age group, and program ID.
4. The `process_diagnosis` method processes the diagnosis data and organizes it into a hash where the diagnosis names are keys and the patient IDs are values.
5. The `flatten_report_data` method converts the processed diagnosis data into an array of hashes, where each hash represents a diagnosis and its associated patient IDs.
6. The `fetch_report` method returns the flattened report data.
___
### Outputs
The output of the code snippet is an array of hashes, where each hash represents a diagnosis and its associated patient IDs. The format of each hash is `{ diagnosis: 'name', data: [patient_ids] }`. If no diagnosis data is found, an empty array is returned.
