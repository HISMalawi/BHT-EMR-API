# Code Documentation
## Summary
The code snippet is a part of the `FilingNumberService` class in Ruby. It contains several methods related to managing filing numbers, such as finding archiving candidates, finding available filing numbers, archiving patients, and restoring patients.

`FilingNumberService`

## Description

This service class provides methods for managing filing numbers for patients.

## Public Methods

### `initialize`

```ruby
def initialize(date: nil)
```

This method initializes a new instance of the `FilingNumberService` class with the given `date`. If no `date` is provided, the current date is used.

### `find_archiving_candidates`

```ruby
def find_archiving_candidates(offset = nil, limit = nil)
```

This method finds patients that have an active filing number that are eligible for archiving. The search order is as follows:

1. Patients with outcome 'Patient died'
2. Patients with outcome 'Patient transferred out'
3. Patients with outcome 'Treatment stopped'
4. Patients with outcome 'Defaulted'

The `offset` and `limit` parameters can be used to control the number of results returned. If no `offset` is provided, it defaults to 0. If no `limit` is provided, it defaults to 12.

### `find_available_filing_number`

```ruby
def find_available_filing_number(type)
```

This method searches for an available filing number of the given `type`. The current filing number format does not allow numbers exceeding the value of `PHYSICAL_FILING_NUMBER_LIMIT`.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example documentation for the `find_lost_active_filing_number` method in the `FilingNumberService` class:

### `find_lost_active_filing_number`

```ruby
def find_lost_active_filing_number
```
This method finds any active filing numbers that are not associated with a patient.

An array of `FilingNumber` objects representing the lost active filing numbers.

### `archive_patient_by_filing_number`

```ruby
def archive_patient_by_filing_number(filing_number)
```

This method archives the patient with the given `filing_number`.
This returns the Archived identifier of the patient.

### `restore_patient`

```ruby
def restore_patient(patient, filing_number)
```

This method restores a patient with the given filing number.

#### Parameters
- `patient` - A `Patient` object representing the patient to be restored.
- `filing_number` - A string representing the filing number of the patient to be restored.

#### Returns
This returns the created PatientIdentifier object.

## Constants

### `PHYSICAL_FILING_NUMBER_LIMIT`

```ruby
PHYSICAL_FILING_NUMBER_LIMIT = 999_999
```

This constant defines the maximum value for a physical filing number.

## Example Usage

```ruby
filing_number_service = FilingNumberService.new(date: '2022-01-01')
candidates = filing_number_service.find_archiving_candidates(offset: 0, limit: 10)
filing_number = filing_number_service.find_available_filing_number('Archived')
lost_filing_numbers = filing_number_service.find_lost_active_filing_number
filing_number_service.archive_patient_by_filing_number(filing_number)
filing_number_service.restore_patient(patient, filing_number)
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `FilingNumberService` class with the given `date`. We then find patients that are eligible for archiving, with an offset of 0 and a limit of 10. Finally, we search for an available filing number of type 'Archived'.
