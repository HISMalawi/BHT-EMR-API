# frozen_string_literal: true

# Blesses ActiveController Controllers with a get_params method
# which is a wrapper of `params` method that is able to enforce
# the presence of some fields.
#
# Why do you need this? Well, almost all of our parameter validation
# is done at the model level (ie when saving or updating). This
# mixin is here to bail you out in cases where the params you are
# retrieving are not tied to any specific model, for example login
# params.
module RequireParams
  # A `params` wrapper that ensures that required params are present.
  #
  # @param required A list of required fields that must be present
  # @param optional A list of optional fields to be retrieved
  #
  # @return A pair in which the first item is either the params or an
  #         error object containing missing fields and a boolean which
  #         is true if there are missing fields
  #
  # NOTE: If there are no required fields calling this is the equivalent
  #       of directly calling params.permit(...).
  #       ie get_params(fields: [...]) == params(*[...])
