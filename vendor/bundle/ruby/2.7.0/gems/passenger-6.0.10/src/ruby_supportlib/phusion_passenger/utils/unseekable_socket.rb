    # Some frameworks (e.g. Merb) call `seek` and `rewind` on the input stream
    # if it responds to these methods. In case of Phusion Passenger, the input
    # stream is a socket, and altough socket objects respond to `seek` and
    # `rewind`, calling these methods will raise an exception. We don't want
    # this to happen so in AbstractRequestHandler we wrap the client socket
    # into an UnseekableSocket wrapper, which doesn't respond to these methods.
    #
    # We used to dynamically undef `seek` and `rewind` on sockets, but this
    # blows the Ruby interpreter's method cache and made things slower.
    # Wrapping a socket is faster despite extra method calls.
    #
    # Furthermore, all exceptions originating from the wrapped socket will
    # be annotated. One can check whether a certain exception originates
    # from the wrapped socket by calling #source_of_exception?

        # Some people report that sometimes their Ruby (MRI/REE)
        # processes get stuck with 100% CPU usage. Upon further
        # inspection with strace, it turns out that these Ruby
        # processes are continuously calling lseek() on a socket,
        # which of course returns ESPIPE as error. gdb reveals
        # lseek() is called by fwrite(), which in turn is called
        # by rb_fwrite(). The affected socket is the
        # AbstractRequestHandler client socket.
        #
        # I inspected the MRI source code and didn't find
        # anything that would explain this behavior. This makes
        # me think that it's a glibc bug, but that's very
        # unlikely.
        #
        # The rb_fwrite() implementation takes an entirely
        # different code path if I set 'sync' to true: it will
        # skip fwrite() and use write() instead. So here we set
        # 'sync' to true in the hope that this will work around
        # the problem.
