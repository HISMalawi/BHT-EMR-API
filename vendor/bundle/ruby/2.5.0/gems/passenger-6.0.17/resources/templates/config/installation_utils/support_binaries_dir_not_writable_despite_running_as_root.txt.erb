This program must be able to write to the following directory:

  <b><%= @dir %></b>

But it can't do that, despite the fact that it's running as root. There's
probably a permission problem, an SELinux problem or some kind of operating
system security problem.

This installer tried its best to find out the exact reason for this failure,
but unfortunately it couldn't figure it out, so it's up to you now. Please
find out what's wrong with your system, fix the problems, and re-run this
program. If you don't know it either, please contact your operating system
vendor for support, or consult your operating system's manual.
