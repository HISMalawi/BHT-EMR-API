    # Returns a string that describes the current Ruby
    # interpreter's extension binary compatibility. A Ruby extension
    # compiled for a certain Ruby interpreter can also be loaded on
    # a different Ruby interpreter with the same binary compatibility
    # identifier.
    #
    # The result depends on the following factors:
    # - Ruby engine name.
    # - Ruby extension version.
    #   This is not the same as the Ruby language version, which
    #   identifies language-level compatibility. This is rather about
    #   binary compatibility of extensions.
    #   MRI seems to break source compatibility between tiny releases,
    #   though patchlevel releases tend to be source and binary
    #   compatible.
    # - Ruby extension architecture.
    #   This is not necessarily the same as the operating system
    #   runtime architecture or the CPU architecture.
    #   For example, in case of JRuby, the extension architecture is
    #   just "java" because all extensions target the Java platform;
    #   the architecture the JVM was compiled for has no effect on
    #   compatibility.
    #   On systems with universal binaries support there may be multiple
    #   architectures. In this case the architecture is "universal"
    #   because extensions must be able to support all of the Ruby
    #   executable's architectures.
    # - The operating system for which the Ruby interpreter was compiled.
