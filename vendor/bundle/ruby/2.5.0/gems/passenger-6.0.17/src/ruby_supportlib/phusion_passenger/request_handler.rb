      # Historical note:
      # There seems to be a bug in MacOS X Leopard w.r.t. Unix server
      # sockets file descriptors that are passed to another process.
      # Usually Unix server sockets work fine, but when they're passed
      # to another process, then clients that connect to the socket
      # can incorrectly determine that the client socket is closed,
      # even though that's not actually the case. More specifically:
      # recv()/read() calls on these client sockets can return 0 even
      # when we know EOF is not reached.
      #
      # The ApplicationPool infrastructure used to connect to a backend
      # process's Unix socket in the Passenger core process, and then
      # pass the connection file descriptor to the web server, which
      # triggers this kernel bug. We used to work around this by using
      # TCP sockets instead of Unix sockets; TCP sockets can still fail
      # with this fake-EOF bug once in a while, but not nearly as often
      # as with Unix sockets.
      #
      # This problem no longer applies today. The web server now passes
      # all I/O through the Passenger core, and the bug is no longer
      # triggered. Nevertheless, we keep this function intact so that
      # if something like this ever happens again, we know why, and we
      # can easily reactivate the workaround. Or maybe if we just need
      # TCP sockets for some other reason.
